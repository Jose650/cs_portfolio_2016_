    <h1> The Big Project Webpage </h1>
    <p> For my Big Project I will be creating a webpage with drop down images so the text can be found in the behind the picture. The webpage will be  about the top 4 batman villians in my opinion I will give background infomation and thier origin of each villian.I decided to do this type of project because recently I have been watching alot of batman animated movies lately and they are very amazing such as: Batman Assault on Arkham, Batman Goham Knight, Batman under the Red hood and Batman Year One. I was so amazed with so many things like: animation, fighting sequences, voice acting and design of the look of each character.

          <p>  The Joker is a supervillain and the archenemy of Batman. He first appeared in 1940 and suddenly became one of the most iconic super villians in comic book history and mostly people instantly recognize the Joker since he was in the beginning comics of Batman and mostly very Tv show with batman. The most popular thing about the joker is his laughing gas which makes his victims laugh consistently with a huge creepy smile. The Joker is a master criminal with a clown appearanc, and is considered one of the mist infamous criminals in Gotham City. He is basically a violent sociopath who kills people for his own amusement. However, in the kids cartoons Tv shows his character changed into a goofy trickster due to the producers needed to tone down the violence for children. The joker has been responible for a number of tragedies in Batman's career such as, including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon who is Batgirl and the brutal torture and murder of Jason Todd the 2nd robin and the Commissioner Gordon second wife murder. Joker is the yin to batmans yang for 75+ years. He was also ranked 8th on the Greatest Comic Book Character of all time list by the Empire he was the highest ranked villian in the list. The joker has became the most iconic villian to batman since the start.

          <li> Mr. Freeze</li>
          <img id="Freezepic" src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/batman/images/2/2c/BAKMFPTSB.png/revision/latest?cb=20160901110334"

        <div style="display:none" id="Freezeinfo">
         <p>  Victor Fries (Mr.Freeze) was a talented scientist, who had a terrible past with a messed up family until he married the love of his life, Nora Fries. Then Nora was diagnosed with a rare terminal illness, Victor'd life began to go downhill. So he decided to put her in a cryo-stasis. So he can buy time to find a perfect cure to her diease. While putting his wife in the cryo chamber their was an accident when the owner he was working for found out he was stealing from him sent a couple of men to kill him shot a tank with subtances made Mr.Freeze skin turn blue.This caused him to only survive a subzero temperatures to prevent this he had made a suit that will keep him at subzero temperature. He also created a ice gun to freeze people trying to stop him. I think Mr.Freeze is the second best batman villian because he has casued batman alot of problems. During one of their fights Batman had to make different suit in order to withstand the cold temperatures Mr. Freeze was shooting at him. Batman has to change his tactics to defeat Mr.Freeze from using heat gadgets to shuting down his suit with EMP's grenades. However it just not about how they fight each other its the respect they have for each other. Usually when the fight is over its about Mr.Freeze's wife nora and how we needs the technology to keep her alive so Mr.Freeze usually steals tech from companys and Batmans is there to stop him or when a other Batman villian wants Mr.freeze to help him or her to kill Batman so they kidnapp his wife Nora but Batman ends up helping Freeze get his wife back into his care.Both Mr.Freeze and Batman help each other out.When Batman helps Mr.Freeze he ends up becoming a criminal and flees off with his wife somewhere unknown.

         <li> Deadshot</li>

         <div style="display:none" id="Deadshotinfo">
         <p> Floyd Lawton (Deadshot) is a gun for hire for people who want other assassinated he is also knowns as the world's greatest marksman 
         and the second most lethal assassin in the world behind Deathstroke. 
         He kills people for money in contracts he oftens works for multiple people. 
         Since he is mostly walking around looking for a job for hire.
         After a couple of years of being a assassin Deadshot realized that he no longer wants to be a hitman.
         So he rather not put his daughter in danger anymore.
         So he uses the money he earn through the contracts to support his daughter. 
         Then turns into anti hero were he kills bad guys only to keep his city safe.
         However Batman still thinks he's a dangerous assassin.
         I think Deadshot is the thrid best Batman villian because he was in one of the first episodes I watched in the TV show Justice League Unlimted.

          <div style="display:none" id="Baneinfo">
          <p>Bane (Dorrance First Name Unknown) he is a super-intelligent world class fighter and tactical genius who enhances his physical strength with a steroid call Venom. This made his one of the Dark Knights one of the greatest enemies. He is the only man to ever find out batmans identity by himself. He often is found working with other super villian groups to destroy Batman, Justice League, or the take over the world.He is mostly know as one of Batmans adversaries. Sometimes Bane is a anti-hero helping his people or Batman in deafeating other villians. One if his most iconic moments is when he broke Batmans back and leaving him to die. No one has been able in injurie Batman that badly ever since that has been Bane movtivater to break Batman into pieces every time they fight.
