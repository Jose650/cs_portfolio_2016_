              To make a Image drop down you'll need to find a image that you would like to use to make it drop down text when you click on it. I decided to make this because I felt it wasn't too diffcult or easy to do. For example, I will use  a picture of Deadshot from the Justice League Tv Show.

                Now you'll have to add Id, div style tag so it can display the text inside the image source tag. Make sure that the div style tag closes at the end of the Paragraph tag. In the Id part of the tag make sure you name the image with pic next to it with quotations in the beginning and end. For the div style tag makes sure you put display:none with quotations and out the id tag again at the end like with the first one but make sure u put info instead of pic because it you want to show the paragraph you wrote about the image you are showing and close it with out the source image code.  <br>
